_________________________

You will be supplied a skeleton project with two modules: 
1. The app module is for you to write a native app. 
2. The wrapper module is for you to configure network calls.

It is up to you to decide whether to keep, modify, replace or remove the pre-existing code in the skeleton project supplied.

**Notes**
* The code provided is just an example of how to access Trade Me's REST API.
* Complete this task as if your code was going to be reviewed by your colleagues. You should aim to write production-quality code and consider usability.
* There is NO expectation that the user of the app will log in.
* There are NO restrictions on the languages or libraries you can use to implement this task.
